# Delivering an ML/AI Strategy
## Project Overview
Congratulations! You’ve made it through the AI for Business Leaders curriculum and have taken an important step towards being an enlightened, responsible, and effective leader in this great era of technological change.

As a capstone to your learning, your final project will provide you the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a practical, hands-on scenario. You will, quite literally, follow the same steps we’ve gone through in the lessons together to formulate a cohesive AI strategy.

The project scenario is similar to that from our lessons: Your CEO has launched an initiative to use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies in key, high-leverage areas of the business. They’ve tasked you with first developing ideas for many use cases for implementing ML and AI, then narrowing the use cases down to a shorter list.

In each project step, you'll analyze each use case from one of the perspectives you've studied, then you'll prioritize and eliminate some of the use cases. At the end, you’ll be well positioned to create a final proposal on the short list of use cases you'll propose for implementation.

For this project, you’ll have the choice of working either in a context that you provide, or in the context of a fictional “case” we are offering you. We expect that you will be interested in focusing on your own business or another that you are familiar with. But in the event that you are limited in your ability to work on a project relevant to your own work or interests, you are welcome to step into the shoes of a senior manager at TeknoVE or Habari Communications, the fictitious case studies that we provide.

Detailed instructions will be included in each project step. The project will require you to work through the seven steps in order, as each step builds on prior steps. These seven project steps correspond helpfully to our seven main lessons in this course.

On the following page we provide directions for working through the project, using the materials, and submitting a successful project.

## Project Business Context Options
### Option 1: Use Your Own Business
Leveraging your own background or experience, you’ll develop ideas for ML/AI use cases for a business that you are a part of or interested in. This will allow you to apply knowledge gained throughout the course to a real business of your choice.

#### Option 2: Use a Fictitious Business - Auto Manufacturer: TeknoVe
TeknoVe is an Irish-headquartered manufacturer of electric vehicles with global operations across China, Germany, Canada, and Mexico. The company operates its own sales and assembly facilities but relies heavily on vendors for certain component manufacturing. They also have a global leasing arm, TeknoVe Financial. You’ll be tasked with helping TeknoVe formulate their business’ AI/ML strategy.

If you'd like to use TeknoVe as your business context throughout the project, please download the "TeknoVe Business Case" doc from the Resources tab in the left sidebar of your classroom here. That document has initial descriptions of 10 use cases for implementing AI/ML in the business.
